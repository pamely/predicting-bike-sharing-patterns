## Introduction 
In this project, we will be building a neural network to predict daily bike rental ridership. The project will help us have a better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation.The dataset comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). 
<a id='setup'></a>
## Initial setup
To be able to complete this project we installed the following softwares and librairies: 
- Python 3
- Jupyter notebook 
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
The project is in the folder `first-neural-network`. The dataset is in the folder `Bike-Sharing-Dataset`. Two files files are important to build and train the Neural Network:

- `Your_first_neural_network.ipynb`: In this jupyter notebook, we load and prepare the data on the one hand. On the other, we buold and train the neural network.
- `my_answers.py`: In this file we create the `NeuralNetwork` class. In this class we implement the forward pass  in the `train` method, the backpropagation algorithm in the `train` method, including calculating the output error and the forward pass in the `run` method.
